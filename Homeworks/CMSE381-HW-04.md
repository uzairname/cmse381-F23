# Homework 4

## CMSE 381 - Fall 2023

## Due Monday, Oct 9, 2023

### Instructions

This homework covers three classes. Problems listed below are from [the textbook](https://www.statlearning.com/).

- Mon 10/2, we covered 5.1.1 - 5.1.2
- Weds 10/4, we covered 5.1.3-5.1.4
- Fri 10/6, we covered 5.1.5  

These problems don't quite line up to individual classes, so I will just list them out below.

- 5.4.3
  - **Note:** "Explain" means no code is necessary. You can use words, pictures, and/or pseudocode to show me that you understand how this procedure works.
- 5.4.5: The `Default` data set is in [the DataSets folder](../DataSets/)
  - **Note:** Here they use "validation set" for what I usually call "testing set".
  - **Hint:** For part (c), you do not need to regenerate the data. You have the same data set, but you are generating a new split of the data. This could be as easy as setting a new seed.
- 5.4.8 (a-e)
  - Along with the problems listed in the textbook, do the following. Repeat part (c) using $k$-fold CV for $k=5,10,15,20$. Plot your results for error vs degree for all these plus the LOOCV version. What do you notice?

*Note: the content from Mon, 10/9, will be included on HW4 due next week.*

### <span style="color: green"> Crowdmark notes

You will upload your homework to the crowdmark website.

- You will be emailed a link to the assessment and will upload your solutions to that page. [Here is a link to the Crowdmark help page with information on submitting the homework.](https://crowdmark.com/help/completing-and-submitting-an-assessment/)
- Answers to each question will need to be uploaded separately.  So this will basically require taking portions of the pdf you were generating before and separating them when uploading.  
- Feedback on the homework will be posted via the Crowdmark website
- Your overall grades will be visible on D2L when they are posted.

### Important Reminders

- Homeworks must be typed. Some options for this include word, overleaf/latex, or by including a pdf of a jupyter notebook (not the .ipynb file please!). Some students have had more success in the jupyter case of printing from the browser window.  The "convert to pdf" option requires you to have latex installed.
- Including figures when explaining your reasoning is highly encouraged.  This can be done as easily as taking a picture of a hand-drawn sketch and including it in your file. Please be sure to include all figures in the main file so we only have to look at one uploaded pdf or document.
- I strongly encourage collaboration and use of internet resources. However, you **MUST** cite your sources and collaborators. See the [Internet Policy and Citation](InternetPolicyAndCitation.md) document in this folder for further information.
- The late homework policy is:
  - Full credit if submitted on D2L by midnight Wednesday.
  - 5% penalty if submitted by midnight Thursday.
  - 15% penalty if submitted by midnight Friday.
  - No credit after Friday.
  - At the end of the semester, the two lowest homework scores will be dropped.
